# Internal temporary approval guide

- See temp. listing policiy in README - if unsure if a server is allowed, better wait and ask nerrix.
- All invite/server links must be app.revolt.chat, not nightly.revolt.chat
- Look for common tags and adjust the submission accordingly. (i.e. there are servers with the `Community` tag, so a submission with `community` (lowercase) should be adjusted.
- Invite and Server links must work.
- Remove all links from the descriptions.
- Original formatting of the issue form must be followed, watch out for the submitter modifying their issue and thereby violating the required format!
- Prefixes must be only the prefix (not smth like `(or customized)`).
- Invite bots first and look if they are online and responding (i.e. use a test server, no intense testing needed)
- If something _feels_ wrong, just ask nerrix. It's still very beta tho.
- Required fields must be filled, look out for "N/A" entries.
- Approving: Add "Approved" label and nothing else. after max. 5mins the server/bot is added and the issue is closed automatically.
- Decline? Close the issue yourself and add the according label. Issues might be re-opened and labeling changed accordingly. 
- Fix stuff in the servers.json/bots.json? Currently only via PR.
- This is all subject to change, especially with the new backend and other things. 
- Ask, Ask ask. This is betaware and before breaking smth it's better to wait a bit so we can sort this out.
